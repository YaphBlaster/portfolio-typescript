The proposed use case is that brokers can give a customer a business card with a custom logo on the back and a QR code on the front that would allow the user to download a companion application. When the user runs the application and points their camera at the business card, a virtual house will appear in augmented reality. Users can then explore the house by pinching to zoom, rotating the house with a slider, and physically moving their device to view the house from different angles. Users can also tap on glowing items, giving the user more information about the different insurance options Wawanesa offers. As the sole developer of this application, I was responsible for all the animation, game design, and logic.",
